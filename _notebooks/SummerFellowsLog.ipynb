Testing_1.pro is the beginning of having the procedure display the sources that are between the East and West horizon RA Hours (RAh). As of now, Master.pro will only display the RAh on the East and West horizon and the user is then tasked with writing those numbers down and using the .CSV search feature to get their own list. I want it to all happen for the user so right after it displays the RAh on the EAst and West horizon, it should display the matching sources from the .CSV file of the users choice in the same format as the search procedure in the first Home Menu option. Testing_2.pro is the beginning of having more calculations added to the procedure.

It looks like there is foam under the sealant that was used and it might be coming from the foam.

The cord works on the RCX400, so it tells me that the port on the 10-inch might be messed up. The cord could also use replacing since even in the RCX400, it didn't make a stable connection the entire time. But even though the wire is on its way out, I think the port on the base of the 10-inch is in worse shape.\r\n",
